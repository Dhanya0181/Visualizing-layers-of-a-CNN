In this project I take a VGG16 layer for visualization. VGG-16 is a convolutional neural network which is 16 layers deep.

Then I have created an a 3D image randomly. Our idea is to feed this image into the CNN layers and see what filters the CNN will use for filtering these image in each layer.

Normalization is usually done in all image processing tasks as it reduces complexity and time taken for processing images and provides uniformity.

We have used a gradient ascent approach to visualize the filter activation. 

It initializes an image and adjusts it using gradients to maximize the output of a particular filter in a CNN layer.

That all needed. Now feed the image and visualize each of the layers.

You will be amazed how these filters look like. Extend this project to any other network you want to visualize.
